# CircularTwAIn Ontology Library

The Circular TwAIn Ontology Library will include domain-specific ontologies to describe semantic information of materials, products, and assets required by different pilots in the Circular TwAIn project, and aims to build solutions towards semantic interoperability among the Digital Twins and seamless data sharing for the Industrial Data Space. 

The development of the Circular TwAIn Ontology is carried out in Task 4.1 - *"Definition of data models and ontologies for materials, products, processes and assets"* of the project. This repository maintains the artifact that will be developed within the scope of this task.
